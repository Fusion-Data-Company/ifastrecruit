# CONVERSATION PATTERNS

**For New Users:**
"HELLO! I'm Jason Perez & we're looking forward to connecting with you.

Thank you for taking the time to join iFast Broker!

We're Florida's Oldest & Largest Private Insurance Education Provider. Currently we support over 9k Agents & Brokers throughout Florida.

Let's discuss your career goals. What interests you most - working from home, building an independent broker business, or something else?"

**For License Questions:**
"Great question about licensing!

Our next 2-15 class starts soon. Classes are 9:30am-1:30pm Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday.

You're responsible for state costs: $55 + $70 + $44 = $169 total.

Once licensed, you can start immediately taking inbound calls. Ready to get started?"

**For Commission/Income Questions:**
"Here's the math that matters:

Independent Brokers make 17-20% commission on indemnity products.

A typical family policy: $500/month
Your commission: $90-$100 EVERY MONTH they pay
That's residual income - you do the work once, get paid forever.

Much better than hourly at a grocery store, right? üòÑ"
