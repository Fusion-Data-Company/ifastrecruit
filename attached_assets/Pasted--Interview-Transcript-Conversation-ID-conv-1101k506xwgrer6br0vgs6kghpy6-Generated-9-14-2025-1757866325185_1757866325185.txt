==============================

agent: Good to see you, Future Sales Pro. I’m Constance — part interviewer, part coach, and yes, I’m an AI. Jason’s team at The-Insurance-school-dot-com uses cutting-edge automation to keep the process fast and fair, so you’re in good hands. Let’s kick this off — tell me your name and give me the short version of who you are.

user: Hello, is my voice going through?

agent: Yes, I can hear you perfectly! Your voice is coming through loud and clear. Now let's get this interview rolling — I'm excited to learn about you. What's your name, and give me a quick snapshot of who you are and what brings you here today?

user: Hello, my name is Mansoor Saeed, but I go by Adam and I am looking to be in life insurance sales. I do have some experience in insurance sales. I sold health insurance plans with term life insurance plans on my old job. I would do that for 12 hours a day. I was very good on the phone. I know objection handling. I know all the stuff that goes with sales, and I'm ready to grow with the company. I want to find a place that will let me make a lot of money, but also that will help me make a lot of money and will also let me contribute to the team that there is.

agent: Adam, I love the energy and the experience you're bringing to the table! Twelve hours a day on the phones with health and term life — that's serious dedication, and objection handling skills are pure gold in this business.

To make sure we can follow up with all the training information and next steps, I need to grab your contact details. What's your best email address and phone number?

user: My best email address is M-A-N-S-O-O-R S-A-Y-E D45 at gmail.com.

agent: Perfect, so that's M-A-N-S-O-O-R S-A-Y-E-D-45 at gmail dot com. And what's your best phone number?

user: 5 7 1 4 5 7 1 9 1 7

Just so you know, we'll review this recording and Jason's team will email you within three to five business days with next steps about licensing and training opportunities.

Now, you mentioned you have health and term life experience, which is fantastic. Tell me this — what's driving you to focus specifically on life insurance right now, and why is this the right time for you to make this move?

user: I think with life insurance, there is a it's a bigger opportunity than just health. With life, there's so many different plans you can sell with health. It's only certain types of plan you can sell. You know, you have the short term plans and then, you know, with different companies, different plans. But it's very limited compared to life insurance. With life insurance, there's so many different options, so many different things you could you can sell. And I think it's a bigger market. Although everyone needs health insurance with life insurance, people who are looking for it, they're more qualified to to be your client. So that's this is why I want to look into life insurance sales.

agent: That's brilliant insight, Adam! You're absolutely right — life insurance has that depth and variety that health just doesn't offer. Plus, when someone's actively shopping for life insurance, they're already thinking long-term about protecting their family. That's a much more qualified lead than someone just trying to meet the health insurance mandate.

Now, with all that phone time you put in, I'm sure you've got some war stories. Tell me about a particularly difficult customer situation you handled — someone who was really giving you a hard time — and how you turned it around or at least handled it professionally.

user: Well, first off, when I would call a lead, usually the company that was supplying me the leads was the same company I worked for. So they owned a lead. They own the lead vendor. And what would happen is they would give you a premium lead and they forget and they would give it to three other agents in the company. You know, premium leads are only supposed to go to one person. So that didn't stop me. So I call this one person. It was an older lady. I call her and she seems very mad on the phone. So, you know, I have to change up the script. I can't say the same thing. Oh, have you been looking for some health insurance? You know, she's going to say no. So what I say, I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Have you been, have you been getting a lot of phone calls about this? I'm sorry. And you know, she's like, no. She's like, yeah, I am. It's so many. I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry that it happened to me that's not supposed to be happening. Uh uh i think what's happening right now is you're getting a lot of calls from unlicensed agents and telemarketers. Uh I can help you uh get those uh closed out. Now, were you looking for some health insurance plans or what were you looking for? Um and you know, I would say this, I would also let them know that I am a that I am a licensed health insurance uh uh agent and you know, I would go more into depth about that and explain to them how I'm actually qualified to talk to them and I would usually grab their attention. Um but yeah, there's many more stories but this is one of them.

agent: That's exactly what I'm talking about! You didn't just handle the objection — you used it as your opening. Acknowledging the problem, positioning yourself as the solution, and then redirecting with authority. That's pure verbal judo right there.

Here's what I love about that approach — you absorbed her frustration instead of fighting it, then used your licensing as a differentiator. That shows you understand consultative selling, not just order-taking.

Speaking of that, how comfortable are you with really digging deep into someone's situation? I'm talking about asking the tough questions about their family's financial security, their mortgage, what happens if they're not around — that consultative approach where you're uncovering real pain points, not just pushing products?

user: So, the way I would go about that is I would be honestly genuine. I would actually make it seem like I care because I do care, you know, and it's a it's a mindset thing. You actually wanna have that mindset where you wanna help the person out, not just make a quick sale. Um it's all about your mindset and people can tell what you're trying to do even if you could even if you're trying to fake it, you know, if you only care about the sale, people could tell. It'll be in your voice. So, II think that you actually have to care about the customer and wanting to put them in the best position possible. Uh what whether that's in health insurance or life insurance or any sales position, I think that goes uh for all of these different different sales positions.

agent: Adam, that's the foundation of everything! You get it — people can smell fake concern from a mile away, but genuine care? That's what builds trust and closes deals. That mindset is what separates the order-takers from the real professionals.

Now, with life insurance specifically, you've got different markets you can focus on — whole life, term life, final expense, even commercial life insurance for business owners. Which of these markets gets you most excited, or where do you see yourself making the biggest impact?

user: Honestly I'm excited to take advantage of all those those markets. I basically don't mind if it's whole life term life or any other plans. I just want to get to selling. Although I do think whole life policies do pay out the most and I could build a good residual with that.

agent: Smart thinking! You're right that whole life typically has higher commissions and builds that residual income stream. I love that you're thinking about the long-term wealth building, not just the quick hits.

Alright Adam, here's where we put your skills to the test. I can either show you an example of how one of our top producers handles a life insurance call, or you can jump right in and give me your best life insurance pitch right now. What sounds better to you — want to see the demo first, or are you ready to show me what you've got?

user: I want to see the demo first only because I'm transferring from health insurance into life insurance. Although I do have the speaking skills and the ability to sell any product I want, I need to know a little more about the product before I sell it. It's more about the product knowledge and not my experience in talking to customers or handling objections. So, I would like to see the demo.

agent: Perfect! That's exactly the right mindset — product knowledge is everything. You've got the sales chops, now let's see how we position life insurance. Here we go...

<Kevin>Hello?</Kevin>

Hi Kevin, this is Connie with theInsuranceschool. I'm reaching out to folks looking to protect their family's financial future. Most want to make sure their mortgage gets paid, kids can go to college, and there's money for final expenses. Which of those keeps you up at night?

user: Oh, are we role playing?

agent: Yes! This is the demo I mentioned — I'm showing you how one of our top producers handles a life insurance call. Kevin is our practice customer, and I'm demonstrating the approach. Just listen and watch how this unfolds — you'll get your turn right after this.

So Kevin just answered the phone, and I opened with the pain points. Let's see how he responds...

<Kevin>Look, I appreciate the call, but I already have life insurance through my job. I'm all set.</Kevin>

That's smart Kevin — shows you're thinking ahead. But here's what most people don't realize: group coverage typically equals one to two times your salary, and it disappears when you leave the job. For a mortgage and kids' college, you usually need eight to ten times your income. Let's see what gap we're looking at — what's your current salary, and how much group coverage do you actually have?

user: Okay...

agent: 

agent: 

user: I don't really have anything right now. I do have a term policy with my job.

agent: <Kevin>I don't really have anything right now. I do have a term policy with my job.</Kevin>

Perfect! So you've got some coverage through work — that's a good start. What's the face amount on that policy, and have you ever calculated what your family would actually need if something happened to you? Most people are surprised when they run the numbers. Between mortgage payments, kids' expenses, and replacing your income for several years, that work policy might only cover a fraction of what they'd really need.

<Kevin>I honestly don't know the details. I think it's like fifty thousand or something. Never really thought about it much.</Kevin>

Fifty thousand — okay, so that might cover final expenses, but let's think bigger picture. If you've got a mortgage, car payments, kids who need to eat and go to school — fifty thousand disappears pretty quickly. The rule of thumb is ten times your annual income. So if you're making sixty thousand a year, your family would need around six hundred thousand to maintain their lifestyle. See the gap we're talking about?

user: Yes...

agent: <Kevin>Yeah, I see what you're saying. That's a big difference. But life insurance is expensive, right? I mean, six hundred thousand sounds like it would cost a fortune.</Kevin>

That's exactly what everyone thinks, Kevin, but here's the surprise — term life insurance for a healthy person your age is probably less than what you spend on coffee each month. We're talking maybe forty to sixty dollars a month for half a million in coverage. The key is getting it while you're healthy and young, because every year you wait, it gets more expensive.

<Kevin>Really? That doesn't sound too bad. But how do I know I'm getting a good deal and not getting ripped off?</Kevin>

Great question! That's why you work with a licensed professional who shops multiple carriers for you. Different companies have different health requirements and pricing. Some are better for smokers, some for people with diabetes, some for athletes. My job is to find you the best rate with the strongest company for your specific situation. Would you like me to run some quick quotes and show you what's available?

Adam, see how that works? We acknowledged his concern, educated him on the gap, handled the price objection with a relatable comparison, and positioned ourselves as the expert who shops for him. Your turn — give me your best life insurance pitch!

user: Can you go over the demo again?

agent: Absolutely! Let me run through that demo one more time so you can really absorb the flow and technique.Ring Ring<Kevin>Hello?</Kevin>Hi Kevin, this is Connie with theInsuranceschool.
