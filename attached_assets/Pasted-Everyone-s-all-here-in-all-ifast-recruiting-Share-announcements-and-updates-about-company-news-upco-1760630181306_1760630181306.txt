I want to welcome you all to The Insurance School. We are reviewing interviews and will reach out to people individually as the week progresses. We will also add materials and onboarding docs over the next day or two. You are the first to get here but it is about to be very crowded in here.  Do not worry about it at all. We will review each person and contact them

Hi Jason!


Jason - The Florida Local
  12:37 PM
HELLO EVERYONE!
I'm Jason Perez & were looking forward to connecting with each of you.


Robert Yeager
  12:38 PM
Jason is the big dog. I am the process administrator for the hiring and recruiting. I know you will see my name a lot but it is Jason's company. I am the help. Feel free to interact with the CEO and understand that this is a real company and a real opportunity to make money for people who are hungry. He is making himself visible for that very purpose.


Michele Ellis
  12:38 PM
Hi Robert and thank you!


Robert Yeager
  1:02 PM
Yes ma'am.


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:02 PM
Michelle, Tara... I want to THANK YOU for taking the time to communicate with our AI Interviewers. Marcela, ( REAL PERSON ) will be in contact with you tmrw.
1:03
We'll add Marcela into slack tomorrow.


Michele Ellis
  1:04 PM
You are welcome Jason and thank you!


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:04 PM
She'll be your main support throughout licensing and training.
1:04
Thank You!


Michele Ellis
  1:09 PM
Is this remote work only?


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:09 PM
It is however, all your sales support is local.


Tara
  1:10 PM
Is this 1099?


Michele Ellis
  1:10 PM
I am in Missouri and my transportation is down now?


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:10 PM
We have programs for people who'd like to be Independent Brokers and scholarships from work from home opportunities.
1:11
Hi Tara, Independent Broker positions are however, some of our work from home opportunities aren't.
1:12
I really depends on the candidate. Some people are gravitating toward administrative work... others are leaning toward sales.


Michele Ellis
  1:13 PM
I would like remote work


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:14 PM
Same... Office time is dead.


Michele Ellis
  1:14 PM
Yes it is dead
1:15
So what remote opportunities pay per hour?


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:15 PM
Each contract is different.


Tara
  1:16 PM
I would like hourly


Michele Ellis
  1:16 PM
I have a life producer license already. I just need the other two.
1:16
Me as well would like hourly


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:17 PM
Hourly is an administrative job.
1:17
As a rule of thumb... Discuss Salaries.
1:18
Hourly is for grocery stores.


Michele Ellis
  1:18 PM
Ok thank you


Tara
  1:19 PM
Jason you are correct


Robert Yeager
  1:20 PM
hourly is for people who need someone to pay them a fixed amount whether they produce completely or not. There are no participation trophies in this business but there are real rewards for hungry go-getters. If a participation trophy is what you are looking for then this is not the place. If opportunity and positive advancement based on your own success that you can be proud of is what you are looking for then you have struck gold!


Jason - The Florida Local
  1:20 PM
Thanks Tara.
1:21
Let's reconnect tomorrow and I'll give you better insight.
1:22
Today was my first time on Slack... Thank ROB for saying I need to be part of this loop. I completely agree.

Out of curiosity... How many of you currently have a Florida Insurance License?


Michele Ellis
  8:50 AM
I don’t


Gab
  8:50 AM
620


Jason - The Florida Local
  8:50 AM
620 has all the same core insurance law components as a 2-15 license so you're ahead of the curve.


Gab
  8:51 AM
Thank you


Jason - The Florida Local
  8:51 AM
Let's talk about our offer.
8:52
We're Florida's Oldest & Largest Private Insurance Education Provider. Currently we support over 9k Agents & Brokers throughout Florida.
8:52
Agent in Insurance means EMPLOYEE.
8:53
Broker means INDEPENDENT
8:53
Employee opportunities range from commission based work from home sales to, administrative work at an agency, insurer or clinic.
8:54
All positions require an insurance license which we will provide.
8:55
Questions like "How" much is the pay is dependent on the skills you possessed prior to being licensed
8:56
If you were a Project Manager overseeing numerous teams & projects, you're in serious demand within our Local Medicare marketplace.
8:58
People with no experience besides their amazing communication skills... we suggest starting with taking inbound calls from home.
8:58
These entities provide training and most importantly the SALES SUPPORT I mentioned in our add.


Michele Ellis
  8:58 AM
I have a life license in several states and have prior experience


Jason - The Florida Local
  8:59 AM
AWESOME! I believe we just need to help you get your Health license.


Michele Ellis

Yes Jason thank you.


Jason - The Florida Local

Michele Ellis

Jason - The Florida Local

One of our Super-Powers here is helping our Brokers build a strong digital presence.
9:02
So often people focus on PROFESSIONAL & School Credentials when it's the local in us that helps us connect.
9:03
When building your on-line brand, we're going to highlight how having a LIfe Insurance license allows you to help you neighbors prepare for a life they're not getting out of alive.
9:04
Your connection to the policies you choose to sell is your strong connecting point with your client.
9:04
How many of you currently have a personal website or side hustle you promote somewhere like etsy?


Michele Ellis
  9:05 AM
I have Avon


Jason - The Florida Local
  9:05 AM
GREAT
9:05
Avon and companies like that teach us how to deliver good value propositions.
9:05
I like the Avon & Legal Shield Networks.


Michele Ellis
  9:06 AM
I do to


Jason - The Florida Local
  9:08 AM
My personal FAVORITE place to launch new careers is with simple INDEMNITY products like Accident... It's ok to think AFLAC
9:09
Indemnity products are similar because, they pay our CLIENT a lump sum of money if they're injured or are diagnosed with a Chronic Condition.
9:10
Everyone wanting to establish an insurance book of business should BEGIN with covering small life events we can't avoid.
9:11
INDEMNITY Products pay Brokers a residual income meaning... Everytime your client pays their premium you also get paid.
9:12
For instance... An indemnity policy for an older couple w/ kids will cost approximately $500 per month.
9:13
If you're an Independent BROKER, you'll make 17% to 20% on a sale which = $90 to $100 per month in residual commission.
9:14
To all candidates... Your career decision comes AFTER you've been licensed.
9:19
Michele - For you, UNITED has an Amazing Indemnity product available in 17 states. They'll pay yopur appointment fees and state registration fees if you'd like to take calls from home. With your experience, I'd go 1099 / Commission... you'll make quadruple hourly. ( I'm NOT an Hourly fan )
9:19
It would take us long to train you how to cross-sell
9:20
Our team will be jumping on to Huddle up throughout the day.
9:20
Our NEXT licensing class begins on Sept 23.


Michele Ellis

I am just the project manager, but on behalf of all of us, welcome. Jason Perez in this feed is the owner the company and the department with UH. He will return on here tomorrow. My job is to get you from indeed to where we are now for him. Nothing more. @Mathew Mercado and I are assisting Jason along with Ted and Marcella. Jason will give you next steps tomorrow. He was left some in the channel already if you want to scroll up and see who he is. That is who to address your questions to, not me. My ability to know answers ends when you arrive here.

@heatherr barnett YES we're an Authorized Insurance School which makes us responsible for helping unlicensed people to the starting line. @Peter Colon is a scholarship sponsor.
2:14
@heatherr barnett Which license do you have?
2:18
@Ceasar Personal lines includes Health Insurance which gives you a knowledge head start on a 2-15. Our available positions are focused on Health & Accident prospects.
2:20
@Elizabeth Acosta - Thanks for considering the business of insurance.
2:22
To everyone who isn't licensed, health insurance has seasons. Medicare for instance has open enrollment. During these small windows, insurers have no time to train new Brokers.
2:24
We're now in an open enrollment window.
2:26
If you enjoy working with seniors then, you'll gravitate toward Medicare.
2:27
Our work from home positions are the most popular.


Michele Ellis
  2:28 PM
When is Health open?


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:35 PM
Medicare has several throughout the year with one starting in Oct.
2:38
Are you interested in Medicare?


Michele Ellis
  2:38 PM
I was interested in health


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:40 PM
Several of our work from home sponsors focus exclusively on health however, they still require a 2-15 license.


Michele Ellis
  2:41 PM
Ok so I need both?  And how much would that cost?


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:41 PM
Sometimes clients want higher than average limits on accident coverage. Those transition into small life policies.
2:42
$55 + State Licensing Application
2:43
$44 = State Exam
2:43
Aprx $70 fingerprints


Michele Ellis
  2:43 PM
Ok thank you
2:44
When does that course start?


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:44 PM
A 2-15 Health + Life Insurance Including Annuities & Variable Contracts is a 60-Hour course and it begins next Tuesday.
2:44
9:30 am


Michele Ellis
  2:45 PM
Ok so when do we need the funds for all that you said?


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:46 PM
The state exam will usually need to be booked 2-weeks in advance.
2:46
I'd say that's your 1st expense.


Michele Ellis
  2:46 PM
So when is the course over with?


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:46 PM
Fingerprints and your DFS Application can be done after your exam
2:47
2 weeks with State Exam Cram week three.


Michele Ellis
  2:47 PM
Ok thank you


Jason - The Florida Local
  2:48 PM
Crams are worth their weight in gold.
2:49
Your course uses documentation we're REQUIRED to provide consumers so, we'll be killing two birds with one stone.
2:49
Licensing is basically sales training.

Sound off for me in this channel and let me know who needs licensing and who does not. I am going to help @Jason - The Florida Local get the rest of this done and get the rest of our team in here to help you all. We are just now implementing this system as we move through this process.
