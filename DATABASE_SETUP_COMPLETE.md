## How To Use

### Login as Admin:
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Click "Sign in with Replit"
3. Log in with one of these emails:
   - `rob@fusiondataco.com`
   - `mat@fusiondataco.com`
   - `theinsuranceschool@gmail.com`
4. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` (admin access)

### Login as Test User:
Test users cannot log in via OAuth (they're in the database but not in Replit's auth system). They're for:
- Database testing
- Channel access testing
- Jason AI conversation testing

To test as different user types, you would need to:
1. Create actual Replit accounts with those emails, OR
2. Use the admin accounts and change their licensing tier in the database

### Test Jason AI:
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to `/messenger`
3. Select any channel
4. Send a message
5. Jason AI should respond automatically
